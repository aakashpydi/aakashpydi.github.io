Hello! I am a Purdue University Computer Science graduate currently working as a software engineer at Cerner Corporation. [(My LinkedIn Profile)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakash-pydi). Cerner is the global market leader in the Electronic Health Records (EHR) industry. More information about my team and work will be added soon.

I am passionate about technology (particularly data-driven), philosophy, history, and economics. I love coding (see this blog), reading [(My Goodreads Page)](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53458380-aakash-pydi), writing [(My Medium Profile)](https://medium.com/@aakashpydi), watching/playing cricket, gaming, and (time permitting) watching lots of movies/tv shows.

Through my personal experiences, professional work, academic work, and extracurricular work, I hope to develop a specialized technical skill set buttressed by important quantitative and qualitative skills. I hope these skills can help me learn from, and contribute to great projects/ideas/teams.  

Please feel free to contact me using the information below. Thanks for dropping by!
