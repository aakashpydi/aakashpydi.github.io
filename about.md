Hello!

I am currently working as a software development engineer on the [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) [SageMaker Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) team [(My LinkedIn Profile)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakash-pydi). SageMaker helps exciting technology teams worldwide develop and productionize machine learning workflows in a cost-effective and compute-efficient fashion. 

I previously worked on [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/)'s Enterprise System Management (Reliability+Data Engineering) team. We worked on developing utilities and platforms for system telemetry, monitoring and data intensive analytics which helped improve the reliability and security of Cerner's technology infrastructure.

I am always striving to promote a culture of curiosity, camaraderie, and compassion. I am passionate about technology (particularly data-driven), philosophy, history, and economics. I love coding (see this blog, [my Medium page](https://medium.com/@aakashpydi), [my twitter page](https://twitter.com/PydiAakash), [my technical newsletter](https://aakashpydi.substack.com/)), reading [(My Goodreads Page)](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53458380-aakash-pydi), gaming, and watching lots of movies/tv shows.
