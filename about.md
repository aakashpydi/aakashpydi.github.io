Hello! I am a computer science student at Purdue University. (I will update this section over spring and summer 2018). 

I love to read [(Check out my Goodreads Profile!)](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53458380-aakash-pydi).

Note: My Wordpress blog hosted by HostGator got compromised by malware. Unfortunately I don't have backups for the posts I wrote in Fall 2017 (Using Pandas for Evaluating Classifiers, Choosing a Classifier from Sklearn). I decided to migrate (i) my technical posts to a static website powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and (ii) my non-technical posts to Medium [Aakash Medium Profile](https://medium.com/@aakashpydi).
