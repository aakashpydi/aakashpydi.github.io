Hello! I am currently working as a software engineer on Cerner Corporation's Enterprise System Management team [(My LinkedIn Profile)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakash-pydi). We work on developing utilities and platforms for automation, system telemetry and big data analytics which help improve the performance, stability, scale, and security of Cerner's technology infrastructure.

I like to think that my defining traits are being curious, hungry to learn and intellectually engaged, and that my defining values are having a service mindset, promoting camaraderie and building deep relationships. This is the energy that I try to bring to the teams that I work with.

I am passionate about technology (particularly data-driven), philosophy, history, and economics. I love coding (see this blog), reading [(My Goodreads Page)](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53458380-aakash-pydi), writing [(My Medium Profile)](https://medium.com/@aakashpydi), watching/playing cricket, gaming, and watching lots of movies/tv shows.

Through my personal experiences, professional work, academic work, and extracurricular work, I hope to develop a specialized technical skill set buttressed by important quantitative and qualitative skills. I hope these skills can help me learn from, and contribute to great projects/ideas/teams.  

Please feel free to contact me using the information below. Thanks for dropping by!
