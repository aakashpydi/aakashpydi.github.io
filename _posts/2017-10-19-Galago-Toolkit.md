title: Galago Toolkit 
---

I tinkered with the [Galago toolkit](https://www.lemurproject.org/galago.php) from the lemur project as part of [Dr. Chris Clifton's](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/clifton/) [course](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clifton/cs473/) on Web Information Search and Management course at Purdue University. It was great fun to work on developing an intuition for search engine indices.
