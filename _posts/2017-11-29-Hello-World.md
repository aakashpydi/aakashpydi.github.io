title: Fact/Opinion Classification using the Naive Bayes Classifier and the Iterative Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search Algorithm 
---

In this project, I replicated the key results from the paper, ["A Novel Two-stage Framework for Extracting Opinionated Sentences from News Articles" (Pujari, Rajkumar. Desai, Swara. Ganguly, Niloy. Goyal, Pawan)](https://aclanthology.info/papers/W14-3704/w14-3704).

The project entails using a combination of the Naive Bayes classifier and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm to carry out fact/opinion classification of the sentences in a given corpus.
