title: Perceptron and Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation
---
I implemented a Vanilla Perceptron model, an Average Perceptron model and a Naive Bayes model from scratch in this project. [(Link to Github Repo of Source Code)](https://github.com/aakashpydi/Perceptron-and-NBC-Implementation)  

Here is some analysis I carried out to understand and compare the implementations.
