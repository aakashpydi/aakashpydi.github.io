title: Perceptron and Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation
---
I implemented a Vanilla Perceptron model, an Average Perceptron model and a Naive Bayes model from scratch in this project. [(Link to Github Repo of Source Code)](https://github.com/aakashpydi/Perceptron-and-NBC-Implementation)  

Here is some analysis I carried out to understand and compare the implementations. [Link to post on medium.](https://medium.com/@aakashpydi/implementing-a-perceptron-and-naive-bayes-classifier-1d6e65ecbed8?source=friends_link&sk=11c5433ba8428984af9946b1ef56d302)
