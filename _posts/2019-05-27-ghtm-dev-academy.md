title: GitHub Time Machine (Cerner DevAcademy Project)
---
This is a summary of the work that I did in Cerner's DevAcademy over the course of two months. DevAcademy is a part of Cerner's onboarding process where freshly hired software engineers work on low priority internal projects with the objective of learning good development practices and Cerner's dev. culture. Note to freshly hired Cerner SWEs: DevAcademy is pretty rigorous and unofficially serves as the final validation step in Cerner's hiring process. For more information on DevAcademy check out the brilliant [Michelle Brush's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellebrush/) [post on the Cerner engineering blog](https://engineering.cerner.com/2013/08/devacademy/) about how she approached revamping the DevAcademy training process.

Notes:
  1. GitHub only supports search on the default branch.
  1. [CppCMS](http://cppcms.com/wikipp/en/page/main) is a C++ web framework.
  1. The project had been active for about 19 months before I started working on it.
  1. The outdated maintenance docs caused a three day delay in starting actual development work. It took three days of substantial effort from senior mentors and previous team members to resolve the setup issues.
