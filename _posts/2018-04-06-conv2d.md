title: Implementing 2D Convolution
---
I implemented 2D Convolution from scratch in this project. [(Link to Github Repo of Source Code)](https://github.com/aakashpydi/Conv2DImplementation) I recorded my output and performance results below. [Link to post on medium.](https://medium.com/@aakashpydi/implementing-2d-convolution-ebad23f1e43c?source=friends_link&sk=a0d65ec2dced180349b2b9744c18b79d)

The parameters associated with each of the tasks is given below.

### **PART A**
The following two input images were used to carry out the 2d convolutions described in task A.

A Cartoon Image (1280 x 720)

A Checkerboard Image (1920 x 1080)

The output for part A is given below. The normalized output for part A is included at the end of the file.

#### Task 1
The following two images were produced using kernel_1. The checker board result indicates that kernel 1 functions as a form of horizontal edge detector.

#### Task 2
The following two images were produced using kernel_4.The checker board result indicates that kernel 4 also functions as a form of horizontal edge detector. We also observe that the edge detection is more pronounced in this case.

The following two images were produced using kernel_5. The checker board result indicates that kernel 5 functions as a form of vertical edge detector.

#### Task 3
Note that all the output images are smaller than the input image due to stride value being greater than 1.

The following two images were produced using kernel_1.The checker board result indicates that kernel 1 functions as a form of horizontal edge detector.

The following two images were produced using kernel_2. The checker board result indicates that kernel 2 functions as a form of vertical edge detector.

![checker_task3_k2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/conv2d_images/image_output/output_images/task_3/output_checker_k2_task_3.png)

The following two images were produced using kernel_3. This kernel is supposed to be a smoothing filter.
